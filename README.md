# 🌌 Cosmic Watch  
## Interstellar Asteroid Tracker & Risk Analyser

---

## 📖 Problem Statement

In the vastness of space, thousands of Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) pass by our planet daily.  
Although space agencies like NASA track these meticulously, the raw data remains inaccessible or difficult to interpret for the general public, local researchers, and amateur astronomers.

There is a lack of localized, user-friendly tools that translate complex trajectory data into understandable risk assessments and visual alerts.

---

## 🎯 Challenge

Build a full-stack web platform that fetches live asteroid data from space agency APIs to provide a comprehensive monitoring dashboard.

The platform should allow users to:

- Track specific asteroids
- Understand potential impact risks
- Receive automated alerts based on proximity
